# Modeling Jupiter's Magnetic Field

Hello! This is my final project for the class Data Analysis and Visualization for Geoscientists (SPACE 405) in the Climate and Space Sciences and Engineering department at the University of Michigan. This was completed in the Winter semester of 2019.

In this project, I used data from the Juno mission that is in orbit around Jupiter. I wanted to create a model of Jupiter's magnetic field using the simple dipole model of a magnetic field. Using the position data of Juno in three dimensions, I calculated the distance of the satellite from Jupiter's surface, and used this to determine what the strength of the magnetic field should be at that point. Then, I compared that to Juno's magnetometer measurements of the magnetic field.  For the requirements of the class, I also performed many different statistical analyses on the data. I gave an oral presentation on the project to my professor and peers, plus created a written report. The code for this project was created in a Jupyter notebook using Python.

To view the full project, please open the Jupyter notebook file called "Final Project Conrad (planetocentric).ipynb" Other files are only needed if you were to download this project and run the Jupyter notebook yourself.
